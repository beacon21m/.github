### Why Beacon? 

> On the island of Pharos the Ptolemies lit a beacon that turned Alexandria into the nerve-centre of the ancient world, guiding mariners safely into the port of liberty, knowledge and freedom. 
> With free acess to information we can find our own solutions and build our own freedom. The library of Alexandria once represented this freedom but was lost to time. 
> The goal of the project is to relight a similar flame on the internet. To take closed, controlled networks and guide people towards free information, free networks and freedom money.

Beacon is intended as an open standard to allow a market of service providers to offer access to bitcoin lightning wallets and various freedom tech services, with no on device install and minimal barrier to entry inside the applications and chat networks you already use.

Beacon was born out of an initial frustration when trying to deliver sophisticated apps in places where the regular user couldn't afford internet, the internet was bad when they did have it and smartphones barely existed. 

The one thing that always work reliably however, was WhatsApp. So the idea was to hijack WhatsApp (and other networks including signal, telegram, nostr dm, text, mesh) and put the wallet into the chat using an AI chatbot to orchestrate tasks. 

WhatsApp is not an ideal chat network and we wouldn't want people stuck their long term, so all new users bootstrap a full Nostr account and profile and Nostr Wallet Connect for wallet management, reducing lock in and offering a pragmatic onboarding flow from WhatsApp to full sovereign Nostrich and Bitcoiner. 

Beacon is not to be "the wallet to end them all" it is to provide a pragmatic entry point.

A trojan horse for freedom tech.
